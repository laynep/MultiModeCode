History
-------
The multifield solver MultiModeCode is a significant extension to the
publicly available single-field solver ModeCode, developed in:
M.J. Mortonson, H.V. Peiris, & R. Easther, arXiv:1007.4205
R. Easther & H. Peiris, arXiv:1112.0326
J. Norena, C. Wagner, L. Verde, H. Peiris, & R. Easther, arXiv:1202.0304

These papers are based on code previously used in
Peiris, et al., astro-ph/0302225
Mortonson, Dvorkin, Peiris, & Hu, arXiv:0903.4920
Adams, Cresswell, & Easther, astro-ph/0102236


Requirements
------------
A Fortran compiler that can handle type-bound procedures, such as
the freely available Gfortran 4.6.3+ or ifort 14.0.0+, which have
both been thoroughly tested on Mac and Linux machines.
There are no external dependencies, as the code is not currently
interfaced with a Boltzmann solver or an MCMC code.  However, we
have included the DVODE integrator with
BSD-like license in dvode_f90_m.f90 and the CSV module.


Project Directory
-----------------
All files for MultiModeCode are contained in the same directory.
The default executable name is powspec.
All source code is in files with the prefix modpk_*, indicating a
modified power spectrum P(k).
The driver file is multimodecode_driver.f90 with the associated parameter
file parameters_multimodecode.txt.
Output files are prefixed with out_*, in the same directory.
The file dvode_f90_m.f90 contains source code for the numerical solver and
the csv*f90 files have information about writing in CSV format with Fortran.


Usage/Install
-------------
See the USAGE file.
Some general usage documentation can be found in Appendix B of 1410.0685.
The latest code, including patches and bug fixes, can be downloaded from
www.modecode.com.
